# Deployment

gbf-raidfinder uses [sbt-native-packager](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager)
for creating runnable packages. The [sbt-native-packager docs](http://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-native-packager/index.html)
explain the types of packages that are possible.

More detailed descriptions of gbf-raidfinder supported deployments
can be found on the following pages:

* [Heroku](heroku.md)
* [Docker](docker.md)

The original version of gbf-raidfinder runs on Heroku's free tier.
